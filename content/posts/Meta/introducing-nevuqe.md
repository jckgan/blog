Introducing [Nevuqe](https://nevuqe.com), a business and brand built from the ground up. Nevuqe is a research organization with the goal of revolutionizing how we interface with the technology that we use on a daily basis. Its aim is to advance towards the seamless incorporation of AGI into our daily lives once created.

Nevuqe's purpose is solely to advance AI to the point in which it can effectively benefit the greater of humanity - through means of transparency and openness. Our goal is to incorporate the aforementioned AI into our daily lives seamlessly via innovative software and hardware.

## On AGI: An overview of benefits, risk-avoidance, and implementation.

The advent of a future artificial intelligence singularity is inevitable (for this writing, we're referring to Artificial General Intelligence); whether this occurs from within the next ten to thirty years is largely inconsequential. We ("we" meaning the encompassing world governments, citizens, and corporations) presently are given the collective opportunity for net-positive change; this opportunity could usher in a multitude of aforementioned net-positive changes - ranging from the cessation of poverty, the rapid innovation and discovery of scientific knowledge, the resolution of global conflicts, and we as a society could begin the amelioration of the corruptions that plague our socioeconomic structures and governments.

However, due to the inherent nature of AGI, having only positive outcomes is next to impossible. The double-edged nature of AGI becomes increasingly evident once you realise that the above "net-positive" events are merely hypotheticals; nobody is certain of what a post-agi society will function as/succumb to. We can found logical assumptions regarding our future, but we must be cognisant that visions of what's ahead will be predicated upon not only pessimistic/overly optimistic viewpoints - but for the desire for our lives to remain as they are, an averse to change. The eventual enabling of open discourse regarding AGI will undoubtedly allow humanity to navigate and avoid upcoming issues concerning the implementation of AGI into our societies, however, it's for humanities common interest that all parties involved in this discussion are aware of these (for the sake of this writing, few, but important) certainties:

Firstly, we're placed with a collaborative requirement to ensure that AGI isn't treated merely as a consumer commodity; AGI, fundamentally, should not be seen as a product to be bought and sold. This is a substantial addition to humanity, its nature being juxtaposed between an arsenal and an aid. The release of AGI into our world should not be top-down, meaning the access and control of AGI should be democratised amongst the working class, creatives, and public intellects. An open discourse regarding the implementation, replacement, and function of AGI in our societal structures is necessary - but the means by which we achieve this fair discourse is yet to be decided.

Secondly, it's a certainty that a consortium of people would aim to systematically utilise all available resources and capabilities at their disposal in order to effectively govern every aspect of AGI for their own self-interest; their motivations may range from financial and hierarchical gains - to the sheer desire for societal disruption. Hence, this is again my reiteration for the aforementioned imminent democratisation of access/influence to AGI once created; if everybody controls and influences the direction of AGI, then this becomes a non-issue (to some extent). These people will guise themselves under a (faux) compassion for humanity - they will assert the fact that they want a more equitable implementation of AGI into society - but will simultaneously enact regulations for their self-interests; as seen in history, we cannot be entirely correct in appointing somebody to lead with clear intentions, so hence democratisation and open-discussions are necessary.

Thirdly, we must be aware that our bureaucratic regulations are as much a threat to the democratic implementation of AGI as the corporations with ill intent are. With our current political system which is flooded with lobbying money, alongside evident corporate interest - we cannot trust these systems to effectively introduce fair and equitable regulations which benefit all parties. Not only is this an issue, but with the advent of greater access to LLMs - we can expect legalities to become ever more complex and illegible; creating a Kafkaesque scenario in which the average person cannot begin to comprehend the functions and laws behind AGI regulations.

Finally, it should be noted that if we're to maintain an honest approach via transparency, then the very systems that we're implementing into our societal structures should be open-sourced (licensed read-only at the very least). I can personally see no reason as to why these models are closed-source; all I see this doing is appeasing stakeholders and boosting financial gains through licensing, closing-down these LLMs puts humanity at a disadvantage of knowledge and awareness.

## Conclusion

I'll end this post here, and I want to clarify that this post isn't intended to delve deep into the complex political ideologies that I've laid out; this post merely states some beliefs regarding AGI that I personally believe. Throughout the next year, I'll begin the work involved in fleshing out some of the aforementioned arguments/thought points in separate blogs (in greater lengths). However, though my writing is still in progress, I personally believe it's for humanity's collective interest and advantage to begin acknowledging these above topics; the sooner we can begin the safe implementation of AGI into our societies.
