Hi there, I'm Jack Gannon. I'm a seventeen year old founder and software developer.

Lately, I've been thinking about the impact of AGI on our society, the exploration of viable clean energy alternatives (specifically Nuclear Fusion), and how we can address the growing concern for the increasing lack of individual privacy.

Since January (2023), I've been working at my company [Nevuqe](https://nevuqe.com) and our goal is to create products that positively contribute to society.

I enjoy listening to [music](https://last.fm/user/jckgan) both inside and outside of work ðŸ™‚.
